# Exercise: Circles

The circumference of a circle (the distance around the edge) can be found by multiplying the diameter of the circle (the distance across it) by á´¨ (pi).

Here is an approximate value of pi:
```swift
let pi = 3.14159265359
```
## Exercise
Write a program to calculate the circumference of a circle with a diameter of 2. Create a constant to hold the diameter. What type will the constant need to be?

```swift
let diameter = 2.0
let circumference = diameter * pi
// 6.28318530718
print("diameter needs to be a Double so that the multiplication can be done on two Doubles.")
```
